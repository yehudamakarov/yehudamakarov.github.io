It came to be  time to make a Sinatra App. The App would need to operate with a database. And some kind of system where a User can make an account and save things and look at those things they saved.

So with the blackboard, I saw a home page where I could open my app and see a week view. Like a table. 

Sometimes on a random Tuesday, I feel unmotivated and the night after getting home from work may actually be a waste. How am I going to get in a productive mood? 

Maybe if I get lucky my wife will ask me to do something nice that I don't want to do. and I'll DO IT. To be close to her and because that's what I need to do. And look at that grouchy laziness disipate a little bit. That was a positive action with real consequences! Good ones! I did something good that I didn't want to and it helped me feel like I want to spend my night a little bit more productively. 

Now, I can set up a reminder And have that go off every night at seven, but that's not how I build my habits.

I want to start on a once a week basis. And if something happens tomorrow that I realize I should be doing more often, I want to save it, however it helped me, and I want to try to do it once a week. 

Because soon that will be twice a week. 

This is how Growing is used. You realize this is something that you  SEE good outcome from, now lets  write those outcomes down and do this again next week.

And I want people to be able to share that with each other and themselves. 

Like a stress free habit builder.
