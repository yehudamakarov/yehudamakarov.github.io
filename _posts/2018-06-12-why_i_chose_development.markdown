I like fixing things. I like when things get better and work better. I like to make things better. I like to talk to people about making things better.

Understanding the mind as well as all the other things that can drive it, for better or for worse, is something I try to do. I thought I would go into psychology for a while. Or music production. Or game design. Because I just want to make things better and more pleasant. More efficient. More fun.

Then I decided to be a religious Jew. It was a 5 year occupation to figure out how to do that well. And it's ongoing. That involves taking really abstract complicated stuff and making it simple, relatable and workable. It requires making spiritual mystical stuff into a smile, good feelings and responsibility.

It requires learning how to use faith and belief like a muscle group. It asks you to challenge your own faith and put it to the test by *seeing* what you believe in. By knowing what most human beings are convinced is unknowable. It's really cool, but it's really hard.

And then I got married. She is so cool. I don't know how G-d allowed such a supportive, special, kind woman to meet me. But He did. And I'm who I'm supposed to be now.

But hey! We need a house. And things with which to be an operational family. I grabbed a day job at B&H. And one day some really nice guy asked me if I was good at computers and next thing I knew he had me calling a friend of his. His friend told me I HAVE to be a software developer. And I HAVE to go to Flatiron. For a handful of really powerful reasons.

I thought about it... And I realized he made a lot of sense. And that it was going to work. Here I am, and it's just great. I love it and I know I can be very successful at this. Its all about making things better. Things that people like, and use, and grow with. Things that people appreciate. Things that make the world a better place.
